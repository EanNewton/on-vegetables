## Steps

### Make the bechamel sauce
1.  In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat, but don't let it brown. Whisk in the flour -- don't let it brown either -- and once it is incorporated, add the salt, then slowly whisk in the milk, a little at a time to form a paste. Once you have added about half of the milk, pour in the rest and continue whisking over medium heat, until the bechamel can easily coat the back of a spoon, 8 to 10 minutes.
2.  Remove from the heat, taste for seasoning, and refrigerate, covered, until completely cool.

### Make the grilled cheese
1. Preheat the oven to 300 F
2. Spread the cooled bechamel on one side of each of 4 slices of the bread. Sprinkle the Parmigiano over the bechamel and then start layering the remaining cheeses.
3. Spread the mayo on the remaining bread slices and place them, mayo side down, on top of the cheese (like you're making a sandwich).
4. Next up, you'll be grilling these sandwiches. Depending on how many pans you want to use, or how large your griddle is, you will probably need to cook these in batches.
5. Set the pan or griddle over medium heat. Butter one side of the sandwich and lay the sandwich, butter side down, onto the hot surface. Toast the sandwich, adding additional butter if needed. Meanwhile, butter the other side of the sandwich while it is in the pan. Once the first side is golden brown, flip it over and crisp the other side. You can also start to press the sandwich down with a spatula while it cooks.
6. This should be a slow process, as the goal is to have a crispy, gooey sandwich. If the bread is fully toasted but the cheese is not melted, finish it off in the oven.
7. I like to let the sandwich rest for 3-4 minutes before slicing, so that the cheese has a chance to set. Otherwise the cheese may run all over your plate. This is not a bad thing; it just might be more of a fork-and-knife situation, rather than just being able to pick it up and eat it with your hands. Regardless, whenever it's done to your liking, cut it in half and eat it.
