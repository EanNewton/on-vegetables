## Steps

1.  Place the orange peels, sea moss, and chilli seeds on separate dehydrator trays and dehydrate at 135 F for about 3 hours until fully dry.
2.  Using a mortar and pestle, separately grind the orange peels, sea moss, and chilli seeds until they are coarse but not powdered. Measure out 2 tablespoons each of ground sea moss and chilli seeds and 1 tablespoon of orange peels into a small bowl and combine with the salt and sugar until well mixed. Transfer to an airtight container and store for a few months in a dry place.
3.  You can store any excess dehydrated, mortared orange peels, sea moss, and chilli seeds separately, covered in an airtight container at room temperature, for up to 3 months. They could be used to season rice, roasted potatoes, or anything you like.
