## Steps

1.  In a medium saute pan, combine the paprika, mustard seeds, oregano, cumin seeds, fennel seeds, peppercorns, chili flakes, and cloves and toast over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside to cool to room temperature. Process in a spice grinder until finely ground. Toss with the brown sugar and salt until combined. Transfer to an airtight container and store at room temperature for up to 2 months. If you find that it has lost a lot of its fragrance, you should probably make a new batch.
