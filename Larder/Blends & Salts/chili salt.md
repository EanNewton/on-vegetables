## Steps

1.  Spread the chili seeds and ribs on a dehydrator tray and dehydrate at 135 F for 24 hours. They just need to be dry enough to grind well. Transfer to a mortar and pestle and grind the chili to a fine powder. Toss with the salt until combined. Transfer to a jar, cover, and store at room temperature.
