# homemade salt

makes about 3 cups (710 ml)

---

## Ingredients

* 5 gallons (19 litres) seawater (good, clean seawater only)

---

## Steps

1.  To start, you'll want to strain the water several times through cheesecloth to remove any sediment. Next, pour the water into a large pot. Bring it up to just below a simmer (180 F / 82 C). Basically, try to keep it at this temperature for as long as you possibly can. (Don't allow it to come up to a full simmer. Just keep an eye on it and adjust the flame as needed.)
2.  As it reduces down, you can transfer it to a progressively smaller pots. You might not even get it all done on the same day, in which case you can turn off the heat while you sleep and then turn it back on in the morning.
3.  Once the water reduces to the last few cups (finally!), you will think I'm playing a trick on you -- no way this is going to make salt.
4.  And then all of a sudden... salt! It depends on the water you use, but mine usually yields 3 to 4 cups (700 to 950 ml) of fine sea salt.
5.  Transfer the salt to trays lined with cloth towels to cool off. If it clumps, you can flake it with a fork. Finally, transfer it to a container and keep indefinitely.
