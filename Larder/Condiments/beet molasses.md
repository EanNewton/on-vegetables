# beet molasses

makes 1 cup (240 ml)

---

## Ingredients

* 1 quart (1 litre) red beet juice, finely strained
* 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup (120 ml) rice vinegar
* 2 tsp kosher salt

---

## Steps

1.  In a wide, heavy bottomed pot, combine the beet juice, sugar, vinegar, and salt and bring to a slow simmer over medium heat. Cook, maintaining a bare simmer, until the liquid is reduced by 76 to 80 percent of its original volume, about 4 hours. As the liquid reduces, brush down the inside of the pot with a pastry brush.
2.  To test for doneness, drizzle a little of the molasses on a plate and let it cool. It should have the consistency of aged balsamic vinegar. Once the molasses is ready, strain it through a fine-mesh sieve and allow it to come down to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for up to 3 months.
