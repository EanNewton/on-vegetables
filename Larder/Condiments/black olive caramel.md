# black olive caramel

makes 1 1/2 cup (350 ml)

## Ingredients

* 1 cup plus 2 tbsp (225 g) granulated sugar
* 8 oz (225 g) pitted kalamata olives, processed to a fine paste (or store bought black olive paste at room temperature with excess oil drained off)

## Steps

1.  In a stainless steel saute pan, combine the sugar and 2 tablespoons water. Set the pan over medium-high heat and let the mixture begin to caramelize. It will take on the texture of wet sand, but you really don't want to stir it. Don't worry if the sugar starts to crystallize, as you can just puree the caramel at the end should it seize. If you notice certain areas not really caramelizing, you can tilt the pan a bit. But really, just leave it alone and look for an amber caramel color. It shouldn't be reducing or getting too dark. All in all, it should take 3 to 5 minutes.
2.  Remove the pan from the heat and carefully add the olive paste -- it will probably splatter a bit. While it sizzles, shake the pan in a circular motion to make sure it is well incorporated, otherwise it will start getting dark around the edges as it cooks. Let the caramel cool to room temperature and then puree it in a blender until smooth. (You can skip this step if you like , but blending makes for a nicely unified sauce.) Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 2 months.
