## Steps

1.  In a food processor, combine the sugar, bell peppers, vinegar, jalapenos, lime juice, and salt and pulse until you have a coarse paste. Depending on the size of your food processor, you may need to do this in batches. Transfer the paste to a stainless steel pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and fold in the pectin.
2.  Transfer the pepper jam to jars, let cool to room temperature, and refrigerate until chilled through. Store, refrigerated, for up to 3 months.
