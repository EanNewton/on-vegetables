makes 1 cup (240 ml)

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds (910 g) carrots
* 6 tbsp grapeseed oil
* 1 tbsp kosher salt, plus more as needed

---

## Steps

1.  Peel the carrots (the peels can be reserved for Vegetable Steak, see: 312) and then cut the carrots into rough 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes. These do not have to be perfect, as they will all eventually be pureed.
2.  In a bowl, toss the carrots with 2 tbsp of the grapeseed oil and the salt and set aside for about 10 minutes. Transfer the carrots to a food processor and blend until broken up.
3.  Transfer the mixture to a saucepot or large saute pan. Set the pan over medium-low heat, cover, and cook, undisturbed for 40 to 45 minutes. You'll know it's ready when you can smear it with a spoon. (If you take off the heat too early, you will find the texture of the puree to be somewhat grainy after you puree it.) Transfer the mixture to a blender and blend on low speed, then gradually increase to high speed while slowly drizzling in the remaining 4 tbsp grapeseed oil. Blend the puree to the consistency of mayonnaise. Season to taste with salt; it should have a pure carrot flavor. Store in an airtight container refrigerated for up to 3 days.
