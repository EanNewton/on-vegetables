---

## Ingredients

* 3 parts evoo to 1 part fresh lemon juice
* kosher salt
* freshly cracked black pepper

---

## Steps

1.  Keep in mind that this is a guide, rather than an exact recipe. So really, do it to taste, but you'll find that if you put in about three times as much olive oil as you do lemon juice, that it will work out quite well.
2.  Season it with salt perhaps, and even some fresh cracked black pepper if you like.
