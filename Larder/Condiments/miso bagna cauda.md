# miso bagna cauda

makes 2 1/2 cups (600 ml)

---

## Ingredients

* 2 lemons, seeded and diced
* 2 cups (480 ml) evoo
* a scant 5.3 oz (150 g) miso paste (I prefer red miso but any type will do)
* about 3 heads (100 g) garlic, peeled, germ removed, and finely grated
* 1/2 tsp chilli flakes
* kosher salt, as needed

## Steps

1.  Fill a medium saucepot with about 2 inches (5 cm) water (enough water so it doesn't evaporate out during cooking, but not so much that it touches the bowl that will be set over it). Bring the water to a simmer.
2.  Place the diced, seeded lemons in a metal bowl (that will sit snugly over the saucepot) and add the olive oil, miso paste, garlic, and chilli flakes. Stir to combine, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set it over the pot of gently simmering water.
3.  Allow the mixture to cook in your double boiler for about 45 minutes -- the result will be a combined but broken sauce. Remove from the heat and let the sauce coom to room temperature. Taste it for salt, but it should be plenty salty from the miso paste. Transfer to a jar, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 week (and up to 2 months if the solids stay fully covered by oil). Serve at room temperature.
