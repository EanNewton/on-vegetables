## Steps

1.  Add all of the ingredients except the olive oil to the food processor and pulse until the ingredients have begun to break down. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil, continuing to pulse until you have a rough, textured sauce. Be careful not to over-puree into a fine paste.
2.  Pesto is best when fresh, but will hold in the fridge in an airtight container for 3 days if necessary.
