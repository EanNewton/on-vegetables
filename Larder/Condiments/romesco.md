## Steps

### make the guajilo paste

1.  Soak the chilies in warm water for 1 to 2 hours, until they soften. Transfer the chilies to a blender along with 3/4 cup (180 ml) of the soaking water and blend on low speed at first, gradually raising it to high speed, until smooth. Transfer to an airtight container, cover, and refrigerate for up to 4 weeks.

### make the romesco

1. In a food processor, pulse the almonds and hazelnuts enough to get a nice chop -- we're not looking for nut butter, but a breadcrumb-like consistency. Transfer the nuts to a large bowl.
2. Add the peeled peppers and tomatoes to the food processor and pulse to incorporate. Add the mixture to the bowl with the nuts, then fold in the guajilo paste, olive oil, garlic, vinegar, and paprika. Season 1 tablespoon of kosher salt, plus more to taste if needed. The final result should be a rough, textured sauce. Transfer the romesco to an airtight container, cover with a layer of olive oil, and refrigerate for up to 3 weeks.
