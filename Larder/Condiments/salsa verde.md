## Steps

1.  In a bowl, combine the carrot tops, olive oil, garlic, pickle brine (withhold this ingredient if not using the salsa right away), and lemon zest and whisk thoroughly until combined. Use immediately or cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days. If storing to use later, don't add the brine (or lemon juice) until right before serving. The sauce may separate a bit, so just give it a quick whisk again before using.
