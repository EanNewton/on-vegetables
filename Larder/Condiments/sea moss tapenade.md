* 1/2 cup (120 ml) olive oil
* 1/4 cup (60 ml) oil from Garlic Confit (see: 312)

* 2 tbsp brined capers, drained and roughly chopped
* 1 garlic clove, germ removed, finely grated
* kosher salt, as needed

## Steps

1.  Prepare an ice bath in a medium bowl. Bring a medium pot of unsalted water to a boil and blanch the sea moss for 10 seconds. It cooks very quickly. Immediately transfer the moss to the ice bath and let cool. Remove the moss from the ice bath and gently squeeze out as much of the water as you can, being careful not to bruise the moss. Lay the moss on towels (can be cloth or paper) and allow to dry until the moss is no longer waterlogged, about 30 minutes.
2.  Transfer the moss to a food processor and blend into a fine, crumbly texture. Transfer the crumbled moss to a medium bowl and mix with the olive oil, garlic confit oil, lemon zest and juice, parmigiano, capers, and garlic. Taste and season with salt if needed, as there is likely a good bit of salt in it from the cheese. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days.
