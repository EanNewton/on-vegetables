# whole-grain mustard

## makes 2 1/2 quarts

---

## Ingredients

* 6 cups white wine vinegar
* 2 cups brown mustard seeds
* 2 cups yellow mustard seeds
* 1 tbsp kosher salt
* 1/2 cup light brown sugar
* 1/2 cup beer (something not bitter)

---

## Steps

1.  In a nonreactive container, combine the vinegar, both types of mustard seeds, and the salt. Cover tightly  with a few layers of cheesecloth and secure in place with a rubber band or string. Set the container aside, away from direct sunlight, for 3 days. (This rather light fermentation will give you mustard a little extra zing.)
2.  In a saucepot, melt the brown sugar into the beer over low heat. Working in batches, add the beer mixture and mustard seed mixture to a food processor and pulse gently to combine. The mustard should be a cohesive mixture, with some grains broken up and others left whole. Transfer to a nonreactive container, stir to combine, cover, and refrigerate for up to 6 months.
