# brown butter

makes 1 pound (455 g)

---

## Ingredients

* 1 pound (455 g) cold, unsalted butter, cut into 1 inch cubes

---

## Steps

1.  Place the butter in a saucepan large enough to let the butter foam up to 4 times the original volume. Set the pan over medium heat and let the butter melt and break. You will notice the milk solids beginning to caramelize as the butter clarifies. Stir occasionally to prevent any solids from burning on the bottom. If using a gas burner be careful not to let the flames come up too far on the sides of the pot, as the butter will scorch.
2.  Cook the butter until it turns foamy and has a nutty aroma, and the solids turn dark brown. Remove from the heat, transfer to a dry, heatproof contianer (such as a bowl or another pan) and cool to room temperature. Once cooked, transfer to airtight containers. I suggest using multiple 1-cup containers rather than one large once, unless you plan on using it all in one sitting. Be sure to stir the butter solids as you go, to evenly distribute into each batch that you are storing. Brown butter will keep refrigerated for 3 months.
