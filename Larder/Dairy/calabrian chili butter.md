## Steps

1.  In a large saute pan, warm the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, shallots, and chilies to the pan and cook until just fragrant, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. There should be no color on the vegetables. Season to taste with salt. Remove from the heat and let cool completely.
2.  In a food processor, combine the butter, parsley, oregano, mustard powder, and paprika and blend until completely combined and whipped. Transfer the spiced butter to a bowl, add the cooked chili mixture, and mix until thoroughly combined. (You can skip the food processor and just do it all by hand with a whisk -- so long as you're really diligent and don't have any clumps of pure butter.)
3.  At this point you're pretty much good to go. Store the chili butter in 1-cup (240 ml) deli container if possible. It will last up to 2 weeks, refrigerated. It also freezes quite well, and will last up to 2 months when frozen.
