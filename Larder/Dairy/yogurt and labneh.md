## Steps

### yogurt
1.  In a stainless steel pot, add the milk and insert an instant-read thermometer. Warm the milk over medium heat, stirring occasionally to avoid scorching, until it reaches 180 F / 82 C.
2.  Remove the milk from the heat and let it cool down to 115 F / 46 C. Gently whisk in the yogurt and then strain it into a stainless steel 4 quart container. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature for 24 hours. Transfer the mixture to the refrigerator and leave overnight. The next day, skim off just the very top layer from the surface and discard.
3.  If you are keeping the yogurt as is, pack it into smaller jars or containers and refrigerate, covered, for up to 2 weeks. If you want to make labneh, follow the directions below.

### labneh
1. In the restaurant, I line a perforated 4-inch-deep (10 cm) half hotel pan (about 10 x 12 inches) with 3 layers of cheesecloth and then set it over a non-perforated, 6-inch-deep half hotel pan, and it can drain into the deeper hotel pan to catch all of the whey. If you have hotel pans at home, that would be ideal. If not, you can use any largish sieve that will fit over of a bowl or pot and line the sieve with 3 layers of cheesecloth. Cover, refrigerate, and drain the yogurt for 24 hours. Discard the liquid and store the labneh, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
