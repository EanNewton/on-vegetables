## Ingredients

* 1 tsp evoo, plus more for brushing
* 3 garlic cloves, germ removed, finely grated

## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 300 F / 150 C
2.  Brush the bread slices on both sides with olive oil and toast in the oven on a rack until crisp, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the bread from the oven, let cool for 1 minute, then break up the pieces by hand and transfer them to a mortar and pestle in batches and grind until you have coarse crumbs -- not too powdery. Store at room temperature in airtight containers for up to a month.
3.  Right before using the batch of breadcrumbs, I like to season them with the grated garlic and 1 tablespoon olive oil.
