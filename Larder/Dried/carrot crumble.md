makes about 3/4 cup (100 g)

---

## Ingredients

* 2 cups (480 g) carrot pulp (from about 3 pounds / 1.3 kg orange carrots that have just been juiced)
* 2 tsp granulated sugar
* 1 1/2 tsp Fox Spice (see: 263)
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 2 tbsp evoo

---

## Steps

1.  Spread the pulp evenly on a dehydrator tray and dehydrate at 125 to 135 F (52 to 57 C) for at least 8 hours, or until completely dry. You should get about 3/4 cup (53 g) of dehydrated pulp.
2.  Transfer the pulp to a mortar and pestle and grind until you have the rustic texture of fine breadcrumbs. (A food processor will turn your breadcrumbs into more of a uniform powder.) Transfer to a bowl and add the sugar, spice, and salt and stir together.
3.  Store in an airtight container indefinitely at room temperature. Stir in the olive oil until combined.
