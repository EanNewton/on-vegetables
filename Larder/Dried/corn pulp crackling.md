## Steps

1.  After you juice corn, spread the pulp evenly on a dehydrator tray and dehydrate at 135 F / 57 C for 18 to 24 hours,or until it is totally dry and brittle.
2.  If you are not going to serve this right away, you're better off leaving it unseasoned, as it will hold indefinitely. After a day or two of being left out, it should probably go back in the dehydrator for an hour or two before seasoning.
3.  When you're ready to eat corn pulp crackling, break the dehydrated pulp into little clusters, then toss with some salt, sugar, cayenne, and just enough olive oil to bind it. The final texture reminds me of wafers.
