# cured egg yolk

makes 12 yolks

---

## Ingredients

* 1 pound kosher salt
* 1 pound granulated sugar
* 12 large egg yolks

---

## Steps

1.  Combine the salt and sugar in a large bowl. Transfer three-fifths of the cure to an 18 x 13 inch (46 x 33 cm) rimmed baking sheet.
2.  Using the pointy end of a whole egg, dig 12 evenly spaced divots in the cure, being careful not to burrow so deeply that you are exposing the bottom of the pan (you are going to fill the divots with egg yolks and the yolks need to be entirely surrounded by the cure). 
3.  Place each yolk in its own divot. Using the remaining cure, cover each yolk so they are completely encased.
4.  Cover the sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 days.
5.  Remove the plastic wrap, flip the egg yolks over, and then cover again with the cure. By this point, the yolks should be quite sturdy and shouldn't break easily, making the flipping quite easy. Cover again with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 more days.
6.  After curing the egg yolks for 4 days (total), remove the yolks from the cure and rinse them under a gentle stream of room-temperature running water. At this point, there is still an outer membrane, which you may not be able to see -- but I swear it's there. While running the yolk under water, carefully remove and discard the membrane, then set the yolks aside on paper towels.
7.  Pat dry the yolks thoroughly (don't worry about handling them, as they should be sturdy and even if they become misshapen, you can usually reshape them into their original form.)
8.  Lay the egg yolks on a dehydrator tray (not on a pan or dehydrator sheet as you want as much air circulation as possible) and dehydrate at 135 F / 57 C for 2 days until fully dried.
9.  Wrap each yolk individually in paper towels and refrigerate for up to 1 month.
