# mushroom bacon

makes about 4 ounces (115 g)

---

## Ingredients

* 2 quarts (about 2 liters) canola or grapeseed oil, for frying
* 1 pound (450 g) king trumpet mushrooms, thinly sliced lengthwise on a mandoline 
* maple sugar
* mesquite smoked salt

## Steps

1.  Fill a deep pot with at least 6 inches (15 cm) oil (as a rule, never fill your frying vessel more than halfway with oil, and make sure that the pot is fully dry before adding the oil to prevent splattering). Heat the oil until it registers 275 F / 135 C on a deep-frying thermometer.
2.  Working in batches, fry the mushroom slices, being careful not to let the oil temperature drop too much between batches, until they are golden brown in color and are no longer bubbling, 4 to 5 minutes. (If they're still bubbling, it means they still have water content that is cooking out.)
3.  Using a spider / skimmer, transfer the cooked mushrooms to a bowl and immediately season to taste with maple sugar and smoked salt.
4.  As with most fried things, the bacon is best when quite fresh, but will hold in an airtight container at room temperature for a day.
