## Ingredients

* green tops of leeks, spring onions, scallions, or green garlic

---

## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 450 F (235 C). Do not use convection or the fan will blow the onion greens all over the place. 
2.  Place the greens on a baking sheet and roast until the greens are completely brittle, blackened, and crumbly, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.
3.  Roughly chop or break them up by hand, then, using a spice grinder, pulverize to a fine powder. Store airtight indefinitely.
