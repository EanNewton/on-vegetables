## Ingredients

* 12 heads of garlic

---

## Steps

1.  Place the garlic heads in a rice cooker. Turn the heat setting to "warm" and leave the rice cooker on for 12 to 14 days. Be sure to open the cooker every day for about 15 minutes to let out any accumalted steam.
2.  When fully fermented, the garlic should be black all the way through. Let it cool down on a baking sheet until it reaches room temperature. Transfer to an airtight container and store in a cool, dry place -- or refrigerated -- for up to 6 months.
