## Steps

1.  In a small pan, whisk together the rice powder and 2 cups water. Place the pan over medium heat and continue to whisk until mixture forms a paste, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature.
2.  In a food processor, combine the gochugaru, onion, apple, ginger, garlic, sugar, and salt and process to a coarse paste. Transfer the paste to a large bowl. Add the cooled rice mixture to the paste and mix to combine thoroughly.
3.  Put all of the ramp leaves in the bowl and mix until the leaves are thoroughly coated with the paste. Transfer the ramp leaves to mason jars or deli containers and tightly seal. Let the kimchi stand at room temperature, away from direct light, for 3 to 5 days, and up to 1 week. The ideal conditions would be something of a cellar-like environment. Open the containers once a day for 5 minutes to release any built-up CO2. As it ferments, the kimchi will develop a stronger tang. Once the kimchi is fermented to your liking, move the containers to the fridge where they will hold for several months.
