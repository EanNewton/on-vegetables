# sauerkraut, rutabaga, or kohlrabi kraut

makes 6 cups (1.5 liters) sauerkraut, or 4 cups (1 liter) rutabaga or kohlrabi kraut

---

## Ingredients

* 5 pounds (2.25 kg) savoy cabbage, rutabaga, or kohlrabi
* 3 ounces (85 g) fine sea salt

---

## Steps

1.  If using cabbage, remove the outer leaves (reserve for other uses, like stuffed cabbage). Cut the cabbage into thin chiffonade. If using rutabaga or kohlrabi, cut them into matchsticks.
2.  Place the vegetables in a large container and massage them thoroughly with the salt. Let them sit, uncovered, at room temperature for about 1 hour. Transfer to mason jars or deli containers, tightly seal, and set aside at room temperature.
3.  The salt should make the vegetables release juices. If, after 12 hours, the vegetables are not completely submerged in liquid, you will have to add a salt-water solution -- 1 tablespoon of fine sea salt for ever 1 cup (240 ml) of water -- until they are fully submerged.
4.  Allow the kraut to ferment at room temperature, opening the jars once a day for 5 minutes to release the CO2. The cabbage kraut will take somewhere between 2 and 4 weeks, depending on how tangy you like it. The rutabaga and kohlrabi kraut, meanwhile, will take anywhere from 4 days to 2 weeks.
5.  Once the kraut has reached the desired amount of tang, transfer it to the fridge, where it will keep for up to 4 months.
