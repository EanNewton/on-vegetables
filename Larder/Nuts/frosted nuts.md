## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 300 F / 150 C
2.  Line an 18 x 13 inch baking sheet with silicone baking mate (if you don't have a silicone mat, I would rather go straight onto the pan use parchment, as the nuts will tend to stick to and rip the parchment).
3.  In a large bowl, lightly whisk the egg whites (don't aerate, just make sure they are combined). Add the sugar and salt and whisk until the mixture is smooth.
4.  Add the nuts, folding thoroughly until they are completely coated. Pour the mixture out onto the lined baking sheet. Pour in any remaining egg white liquid over the nuts and spread the nuts so that they fit in the pan in a single layer.
5.  Roast the nuts, stirring every 5 minutes, until coated and dry -- but not sticky, about 30 minutes. As they roast you will see the liquid beginning to thicken. Remove the pan from the oven and give everything a final stir. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.
6.  Let the nuts cool in the pan to room temperature, then taste again and adjust seasoning. Break the nuts up and store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
