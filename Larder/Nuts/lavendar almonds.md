## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 300 F / 150 C
2.  Spread the cashews on a baking sheet and roast, tossing them occasionally, until they are golden all the way through but not burned or bitter, about 20 minutes. (I prefer a more gradual toasting process, as it builds more consistent, even flavor.) Let the nuts cool to room temperature.
3.  Toss the cooled cashews with the olive oil until coated. Add the spice and toss to thoroughly coat. Eat immediately or store in an airtight container for up to 1 week at room temperature. As they settle or dry out you may need to re-toss them and add a few drops of olive oil to help the seasoning adhere.
