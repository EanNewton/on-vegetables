* 2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

## Steps

1. Preheat an oven to 300 F / 150 C
2. Spread the pine nuts in a baking sheet and roast, stirring occasionally, until intense golden brown in color and aromatic, about 20 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, in a pot with a metal bowl fitted snugly on top, bring a few inches of water to a simmer over low heat.
4. Transfer the toasted pine nuts to the bowl and add the milk and salt. Wrap the top of the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the mixture steep over the simmering water for 30 minutes.
5. Transfer the nut-milk mixture to a blender and start to puree. With the blender motor running, slowly pour in the olive oil in a steady stream. The pudding should have a mousse-like consistency; if it seems too stiff, add more olive oil. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.
6. Pour the pudding into a bowl and place plastic wrap directly over the surface. If the plastic does not have direct contact, the pudding will form a skin, which you don't want in a smooth puree like this. Set the puddings aside to cool to room temperature, then transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 to 5 days.
