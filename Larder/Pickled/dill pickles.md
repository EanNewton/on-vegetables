## Steps

### for sliced pickles

1.  Cut the Kirby cucumbers on a mandoline into slices 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick. In a large bowl, toss the slices with salt until combined. Cover them with 3 to 4 quarts of ice (just enough to completely cover) and let sit for 3 hours. It will be mostly melted by the end.
2.  Drain the liquid and transfer the cucumbers to a nonreactive 12-quart container (this could be a mixing bowl or even a large pot). Add the onions, garlic, and dill and toss to combine.
3.  In a large pot, combine the vinegar, 1 quart water, the sugar, mustard seeds, and black pepper and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Once the sugar has dissolved, pour the mixture over the cucumbers and let everything cool to room temperature. Transfer the pickles, and their pickling liquid to airtight containers, and refrigerate for up 3 months.

### for whole gherkins

1. In a large nonreactive container, combine the Mexican sour gherkins, onions, garlic, and dill, and toss to combine. Set aside.
2. Meanwhile, in a large pot, combine the vinegar, 1 quart water, the salt, sugar, mustard seeds, and black-pepper and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.
3. Over the salt and sugar have dissolved, pour the mixture over the cucumbers and let everything cool to room temperature. Transfer the pickles and their pickling liquid, to jars, seal, and refrigerate. The pickles will keep for up to 4 months, refrigerated.
