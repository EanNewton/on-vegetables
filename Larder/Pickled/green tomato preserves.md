## Steps

1.  In a heavy-bottomed pot, combine the tomatoes, brown sugar, onion, raisins, vinegar, mustard seeds, fennel seeds, chili flakes, salt, allspice, and cinnamon sticks. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Let the jam simmer, uncovered, until the mixture turns syrupy, 2 to 3 hours. Be careful not to overcook, or the jam will seize up like rock sugar. Remove from the heat and ladle into a storing container, or run the jam through a food mill if you want a smoother consistency. (If you are using a food mill, be sure to remove t he cinnamon sticks prior to milling.) The preserves will keep for up to 1 month in an airtight container under refrigeration. Serve the jam either at room temperature or chilled.
