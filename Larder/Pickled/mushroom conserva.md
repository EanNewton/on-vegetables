## Steps

1.  In a bowl of water, quickly wash the mushrooms, agitating them with your hands and letting the dirt fall off. Drain the mushrooms and let them dry on towels for at least 15 minutes.
2.  Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl, toss with the salt and let it sit for 30 minutes (this will help pull the moisture out of the mushrooms once they start cooking).
3.  In a medium saucepot, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms release liquid and it evaporates, 5 to 10 minutes.
4.  Add the remaining 6 tablespoons olive oil, the brine, and rosemary. Bring to a boil, remove from the heat, cover, and let the mushrooms steep in the liquid for 20 minutes.
5.  Transfer the conserva to a food processor and pulse it gently until a chunky, coarse paste forms.
6.  Cool the conserva to room temperature, ladle into airtight containers, and refrigerate for up to 1 week.
