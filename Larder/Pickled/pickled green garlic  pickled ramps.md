## Steps

### for garlic

Trim any discolored tops from the garlic and thinly slice the bulbs

### for ramps

Cut off the greens and reserve for Ramp Kimchi (see: 296). Leave the bulbs whole, but trim off the "beards".

1.  Place the garlic / ramps in a heatproof nonreactive container.
2.  In a saucepan, combine the vinegar, 1 cup (240 ml) water, the sugar, salt, mustard seeds, coriander, and pepper and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Remove the pickling solution from the heat and pour it over the garlic / ramps. Allow the garlic / ramps to cool to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate. The garlic / ramps are ready to eat after 3 days and will keep for up to 4 months refrigerated.
