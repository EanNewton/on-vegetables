## Makes 2.5 lb / 1 kg roasted peppers and about 1 cup / 240 ml pepper tears

---

## Ingredients

* 5 lb / 2.25 kg red bell peppers

---

## Steps

1. Char the peppers over an open flame - on a grill or directly over the gas burner on your stove -- until they are blackened all over, using tongs to move them around.
2. Transfer the peppers to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap -- the steam will make the peppers easier to peel when cool.
3. Once the peppers are cool enough to handle, carefully peel, stem, and seed the peppers over a bowl, being careful to reserve all of the juices ("tears"). Discard the stems and seeds (and reserve the charred skins for Fig, Pepper Skin and Riesling Jam (see: 268)). Use immediately or refrigerate (in separate airtight containers) for up to 1 week
