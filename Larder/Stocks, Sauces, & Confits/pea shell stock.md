* 1 garlic clove, smashed, germ removed
* 1 shallot, sliced

## Steps

1. Wrap the pea pods, mint sprigs, garlic, and shallot in cheesecloth, then tie it up with twine into a bundle.
2. In a pot, combine 1 quart / 1 liter water and the sachet. Set the pot over low heat, but don't let the stock bubble or the drab color of the pods will start to bleed into the stock -- you want to steep the sachet to clear a broth.
3. After 2 hours, remove the sachet, allow it to drain back into the pot for a moment, then discard. Transfer the stock to an airtight container, cover, and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 2 months.
