## Steps

1.  Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Salt it so that it tastes like the sea. Meanwhile, prepare an ice bath in a large bowl. Blanch the broccoli in the boiling water for 1 minute -- just long enough to turn the color a more vibrant green -- and transfer to the ice bath until cool. Drain and dry the broccoli.
2.  Place a large frying pan over medium-high heat and preheat for 3 minutes. Add the oil, then the broccoli. Cook until hot, giving it a little color if you'd like, 2-3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add the garlic, lemon juice, and salt to taste (the lemon will also help to cool down the pan).
3.  Divide the broccoli across plates and place a mound of burrata in the center of each plate. Drizzle the burrata with some olive oil and garnish with flaky sea salt and black pepper.
