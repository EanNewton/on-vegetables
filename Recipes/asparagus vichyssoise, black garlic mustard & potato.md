## Steps

### make the spring vichyssoise

1. Thinly slice the ramp bulbs. Give the ramp greens a rough chop and set aside.
2. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the ramp bulbs and season with salt. Cook the bulbs, stirring, until they are translucent -- don't let the bulbs take on any color -- about 10 minutes.
3. Add the asparagus and garlic, season with salt, and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the pea shell stock and bring everything to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, until the asparagus is soft enough to be pureed, 25 to 30 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, prepare an ice bath in a large bowl and bring a pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Blanch the peas in boiling water for around 3 minutes, or until just tender. Shock in the ice bath until completely cool, drain, and transfer to towels to dry.
5. Add the heavy cream to the soup and bring to a simmer. Remove the soup from the heat and add the reserved ramp greens, peas, cilantro, parsley, and mint leaves. Working in batches, puree the soup in a blender until smooth. Strain the soup through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and cool down quickly by placing the bowl of soup into a larger bowl filled with  ice, whisking until it's room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until completely cold before serving, and for up to a day in advance.

### make the crushed potato

1. Follow the cooking method for poaching potatoes on (see: 46). When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them and transfer them to a bowl. Add the olive oil and lightly crush the potatoes with a fork. Add the ramp bulbs and chives, and season to taste with salt. Allow the potatoes to cool to room temperature before serving.

### to serve

1. In 4 individual bowls, pile crushed potatoes and a dollop of the black garlic mustard on one side of each bowl. Garnish with some shaved green asparagus and white asparagus tips, then ladle the soup on the other side of the bowl.
