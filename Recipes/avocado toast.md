## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 350 F
2.  Place the flaxseeds and sunflower seeds in separate small baking pans (in case they cook at different speeds) and toast in the oven until fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to a plate.
3.  Meanwhile, toast the bread in a toaster (mini) oven, o r brushed with olive oil in a preheated cast-iron skillet over medium heat. (Both methods work quite well here.) Once toasted, season the bread lightly with kosher salt.
4.  While the bread is toasting, scoop the avocados into a bowl. Add the olive oil and season with kosher salt and black pepper. Mash it with a fork until chunky but spreadable.
5.  Spread the avocado mixture over the toast and arrange the tomatoes on top cut-side up. Top with dollops of the tapenade, toasted seeds, calendula petals (if using), and flaky sea salt.
