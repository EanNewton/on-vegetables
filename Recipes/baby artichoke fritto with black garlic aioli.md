## Steps

1.  Fill a bowl with 4 cups of ice water. Halve 2 of the lemons and squeeze their juice into the ice water; drop the empty lemon halves in.
2.  Use a bird's beak knife to trim away any large outer leaves from the artichoke and then gently trim off the outermost layer of the stem. Cut off the tip of the artichoke, creating a flat top, and place each trimmed artichoke into the acidulated ice water to prevent discoloration.
3.  Meanwhile, in a large pot, bring the vegetable stock to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and season to taste with salt.
4.  Add the artichokes to the pot. Cut out a round of parchment paper that will fit snugly inside the pot (a cartouche). Lay the cartouche over the artichokes and cook at just below a simmer until barely tender, about 45 minutes.
5.  Remove the pot from the heat and let the artichokes cool to room temperature in the broth. Remove them from the broth and using the top of a teaspoon, scoop out any inedible fuzz from the cavity. Dry the artichokes on towels until they're completely dry before you fry them (if not, they might splatter and/or cause the oil to overflow when they're fried).
6.  Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together the aioli and black garlic puree until combined.
7.  In a Dutch oven or deep, heavy pot, heat the olive and grapeseed oils over medium-high heat until the oil registers 350 F on a deep-frying thermometer.
8.  Meanwhile, lightly dredge the artichokes in the rice flour, shaking off the excess.
9.  Working in batches, carefully slide the artichokes into the hot oil -- being careful not to crowd the pan or let the oil temperature drop too much -- and fry until the artichokes are golden and crisp. Remove the artichokes from the oil and place on paper towels. Season immediately with salt and a squeeze of lemon. Serve immediately, with black garlic aioli and garnished with black garlic.
