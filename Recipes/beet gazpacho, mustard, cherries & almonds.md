## Steps

1.  In a large pot, combine the beets, onions, bell pepper, vinegar, chopped garlic, and 1 quart water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, uncovered, until the vegetables are very soft, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
2.  Working in batches, blend thoroughly until smooth, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve or chinois. Transfer to a container, cover, and refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours. Season to taste with salt -- you will probably find that a cold soup requires more salt than a hot one. The gazpacho will keep for 3 to 5 days under refrigeration.
3.  Meanwhile, in a small bowl, fold the horseradish goat cheese and mustard together until incorporated. Refrigerate until needed. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.
4.  Ina  small saute pan, combine the sliced garlic and olive oil and set the pan over medium heat. Set a sieve over a small bowl. Slowly cook the garlic, shaking the pan occasionally as it cooks, until evenly golden throughout, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain the garlic oil through the sieve into the bowl and set the oil aside. Transfer the sliced garlic to a paper towel and sprinkle with salt.
5.  Ladle the cold gazpacho into 4 bowls. Place a quenelle or dollop of mustard-horseradish cheese on top and garnish with cherries, almonds, garlic chips, and garlic oil. Finish with the small florets of flowering brassica.
