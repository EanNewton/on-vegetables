## Steps

### make the roasted beets

1. Follow the instructions for roasting and peeling beets on (see: 40). Cut the peeled beets into whatever size and shape you like and toss them with olive oil, red wine vinegar, and salt to taste. Set the beets aside to cool until plating.

### make the red quinoa

1. Rinse the quinoa under cold running water. In a pot, combine the quinoa and 1 1/3 cup cool water. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Cover, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook until all the water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat, fluff the quinoa with a fork, and toss it with the 2 tsp of the olive oil, the mint, lemon zest and juice, and salt to taste. Cool the quinoa to room temperature or cooler before serving.
2. In a bowl, toss the berries in a bowl with the remaining 3 tbsp olive oil and the juices combine. (sic) Right before serving, halve and pit the avocado, then scoop the avocado flesh into a bowl. Add the olive oil, salt to taste, and a healthy dose of black pepper. Mash it with a fork until well combined.

### to serve

1. To serve, either portion onto 4 individual plates or bowls or onto 1 large platter and serve family-style. Lay a dollop of the avocado first, and follow with some quinoa. Arrange the beets over the avocado and quinoa, then spoon the berry mixture on top. Garnish with beet soil and finish with the fresh berries.
