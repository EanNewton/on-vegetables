## Steps

### make the beets
1.  Follow the cooking instructions for roasting and peeling beets on (see: 40). While the beets are still warm, cut them into coins, 1/8 inch thick. Season to taste with salt and dress with the vinegar and oil.
2.  Meanwhile, thoroughly wash and dry the reserved beet stems -- they tend to collect a lot of sand. Tear the leaves into rustic 1-inch pieces. Cut the stems into small dice.

### make the beet green marmalade
1. In a large saute pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the stems, season with salt, and cook them gently, stirring until just tender, about 8 minutes. Add the torn leaves, vinegar, sugar and a touch more salt.
2. Reduce the heat to low and cook gently until the stems and leaves are tender and about 90 percent of the liquid is cooked off, 20 to 30 minutes. Transfer the greens to a plate and let cool to room temperature.
3. Chop finely until you have a unified mixture. Taste and adjust the seasoning.

### to serve
1. Arrange the sliced beets in 4 bowls or on plates. Follow with the figs. Form a quenelle (or dollop) with the beet marmalade and set it on the side of the plate.
2. Thinly slice the blue cheese with a hot, wet knife and lay it over the top of the bowl (if it crumbles that's fine too). Sprinkle with the walnuts and garnish with the spinach.
