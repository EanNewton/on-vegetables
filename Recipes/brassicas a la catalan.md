## Steps

1.  Follow the trimming instructions (see: ) for the brassicas. Everything should be in bite-size pieces.
2.  In a bowl, toss the brassicas with the olive oil. Season pretty aggressively with salt, as this is the only salt added to the dish.
3.  To serve, spoon the pine nut pudding on one side of each of 4 bowls and lay down the dressed brassicas on top. Sprinkle with the raisins and pine nuts on top, followed by mint leaves. Finally, gently pour the pepper tears on the opposite side of the bowl from the pine nut pudding.
