## Steps

1.  Snap off the base of the asparagus -- it will have a natural place where  it wants to break off.
2.  Bring 6 to 8 quart stockpot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, prepare an ice bath in a large bowl.
3.  Cut the asparagus into 1 inch pieces and add them to the boiling water for 45 seconds. Drain the asparagus and immediately plunge into the prepared ice bath until completely chilled. Drain the asparagus on towels and set aside.
4.  Place half of lemon juice into a bowl and add the saffron to let it bloom -- the acid will help the colors leach out. Add the yogurt and season to taste with salt -- the yogurt should have taken on color from the saffron.
5.  Dress the asparagus  with the olive oil and season to taste with salt and remaining lemon juice. Arrange the asparagus on the plate. Fill in the gaps with dots of black olives caramel and dollops of the saffron yogurt. Top with the toasted almonds and fennel pollen.
