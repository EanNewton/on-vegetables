## Steps

1.  In a medium saucepot, combine the corn kernels and stock with a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce to medium-low and cook at a simmer, uncovered, until the kernels are completely tender, 20-25 minutes. Remove from the heat. Transfer half of the corn to a blender and puree until smooth. Return the blended corn to the pot and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning, if needed.
2.  Dry the vanilla pod in a dehydrator for 6-8 hours at 135 F, or until completely dry. Break the pod up with your hands and grind in a coffee grinder to a fine powder. Store, indefinitely, at room temp in an airtight container.
3.  Divide the corn across 4 bowl and top with a quenelle or dollop of jam. Finish with ground vanilla pod.
