## Steps

1.  Set up a large bowl of cold water and squeeze the juice of 1 lemon into it -- this will keep the artichokes from browning.
2.  Trim the artichokes down to just the hearts and a bit of stem. Halve them lengthwise after they've been trimmed and scoop out the fuzzy choke with a spoon. Keep the trimmed in the acidulated water while you work on the remaining ones.
3.  On a mandoline, slice the artichokes into thin, but not paper thin slices -- you want them to have a little bit of bite. Immediately squeeze the remaining lemon over the artichoke and dress with the creme fraiche, olive oil, and parsley, and season to taste with salt.
4.  Toast the brioche slices, either in a toaster (mini) oven or with some oil in a preheated cast-iron pan over medium heat, until the bread is golden brown on both sides. Top the brioche slices with the artichoke mixture, followed by the pickled ramps. Finish with lemon zest, pepper to taste, and a few leaves of arugula.
