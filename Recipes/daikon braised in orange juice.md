---

## Ingredients

* 1 very large daikon radish, cut into slices 1/2 to 3/4 inch
* 2 1/2 cup strained fresh orange juice
* 2 tsp kosher salt

## Steps

1.  In a pan at least 12 inches wide, combine the daikon, orange juice, and salt in a single layer. Set the pan over medium heat and cook the daikon until the orange juice evaporates below the surface of the daikon. Carefully flip the slices - they should be fairly soft at this point, and easily damaged if you're not careful.
2.  As the daikon continues to cook, gradually baste it with the reducing orange juice until the daikon is quite tender but still holding together well. It will be around 35-40 minutes of total cooking time.
