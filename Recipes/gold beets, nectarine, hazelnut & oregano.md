* 3 nectarines

## Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 350 F
2.  Thoroughly wash and dry the beets and place them in a 12x6 inch baking dish with the whole nectarines and orange juice.
3.  Cover the dish with foil and bake until the beets are tender when a cake tester easily slides in an out of the beets, 30-45 minutes. Remove the foil. Let the beets cool down just enough to handle, then using either gloves or a tea towel, peel off and discard the outer skin. Halve the beets and toss with the champagne vinegar, olive oil, and salt to taste.
4.  Halve and pit the nectarines -- which should be as easy as pulling braised meat from the bone -- and place in a blender, along with the preserved lemon. Blend together until a fine puree forms. It should be the consistency of baby food, slightly looser than a mousse or pudding. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
5.  To serve, place the nectarine puree around each plate in 8 dollops. Lay a halved beet on each dollop, cut side up. Place another small dollop of puree on top, then use it to anchor each hazelnut half atop, as well as a leaf of oregano.
