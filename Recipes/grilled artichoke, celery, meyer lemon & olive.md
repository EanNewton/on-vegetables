## Steps

1.  I don't trim artichokes too much -- I just take off whatever leaves are on the stem. Then steam the artichokes whole. You can use a steamer basket or bamboo steamer with water underneath. Cook the artichokes until the heart of the stem is tender and the leaves can easily be pulled off, in 20 to 30 minutes.
2.  Meanwhile, in a bowl, toss together the celery leaves, pickled garlic brine, olive oil, and garlic. Finely grate the zest of 2 Meyer lemons and add to the salsa. Squeeze the lemon juice in, mix thoroughly and season to taste with salt.
3.  Remove the artichokes from the steamer and halve lengthwise. Using a small spoon, scoop out the inedible choke, being careful not to nick up any of the actual meat.
4.  Prepare your outdoor gas or charcoal grill and bring to a high heat. Brush the cut sides of the artichokes with oil. Season with salt and grill, cut-side down, until the artichokes get a nice, even char, 3 to 4 minutes. Halve the last lemon and squeeze it over the artichokes while still hot.
5.  Season the artichokes again with salt and transfer to a plate. Spoon the salsa over the artichokes and dot with the olive caramel. Finish with additional celery leaves.
