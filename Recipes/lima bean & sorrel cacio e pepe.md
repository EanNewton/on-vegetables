## Steps

1.  Place the lima beans in a pot filled with 4 cups cold water. Place the garlic and rosemary in a single-layer square of cheesecloth, tie it into a sachet, and add it to the pot with the beans. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low and cook, uncovered, at just below a simmer, until the beans are tender, 30 to 40.
2.  Remove the pot from the heat, discard the sachet, and add the torn sorrel, black pepper, and salt to taste. (You will notice that the sorrel turns drab quickly, but that's okay. It's about the flavor more than the appearance, with tart sorrel standing in place of lemon to balance out the other ingredients.)
3.  Right before serving, fold the butter into the beans.
4.  To serve, warm the bowls and add 1 tsp of the garlic confit puree to the bottom of each bowl. Spoon the beans and their broth into the bowls (since black pepper tends to settle to the bottom of the pot, make sure to re-stir the soup before each ladle.)
5.  Finish with the chiffonade of sorrel, grated pecorino, garlic confit oil, and cured egg yolk.
