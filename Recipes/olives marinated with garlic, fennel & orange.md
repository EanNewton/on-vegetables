## Steps

1.  Bring a medium pot of water to a simmer over medium high heat.
2.  Meanwhile, in a metal bowl, combine the olive oil, garlic and fennel seed.
3.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set it over the pot so it fits snugly, but the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Cook until the garlic is fragrant and no longer raw, about 30 minutes.
4.  Remove from the heat and toss with the olives, and orange zest and juice. Serve immediately, while warm, or refrigerate for up to 2 days.
