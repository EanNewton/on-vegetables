## Steps

1.  Bring a pot of salted water to a boil over medium high heat. Prepare an ice bath. Add the peas to the boiling water and blanch until tender but not too soft, about 2 minutes. Drain and immediately chill in ice bath, allow to dry on a tea towel.
2.  Gently squeeze each pea to remove the two halves inside the skin and transfer to a bowl. Season with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt to taste.
3.  Combine the pea shell stock and champagne vinegar and season to taste.
4.  To serve, divide the peas across 6 bowls. Top with the white chocolate and macadamia nuts. Garnish with mint leaves, pea tendrils, and blossoms. At the table, pour over the pea shell stock and garnish with dots of olive oil.
