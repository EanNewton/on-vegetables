## Steps

1.  In a pot, bring 2 quarts of water with the vinegar to a boil. In a large bowl, prepare an ice bath. Gently slide the cold eggs into the boiling water and cook at a light simmer for 9 minutes. Transfer the eggs to the ice bath and leave for around 5 minutes. Remove the eggs from the ice bath, then peel, roughly chop, and set aside.
2.  Follow the directions for trimming, peeling and tying the asparagus in bundles on (see: 38). Bring a pot of heavily salted water to a boil. (It should have enough water so that you won't lose your boil once you add the asparagus.)
3.  While the water comes to a boil, melt the brown butter in a pan over low heat, being careful not to burn or overcook it. Remove the brown butter from the heat and add the chopped eggs, black pepper, nutmeg, and kosher salt to taste. Quickly add the butter to the brown butter sauce, and fold it in to combine.
4.  Blanch the asparagus in the boiling water. Drain and dry the asparagus briefly on towels, then squeeze over it the juice of your quartered lemon.
5.  To serve, lay the warm asparagus on plates. Spoon the warm egg sauce over the top and then finish with the breadcrumbs, cured egg yolks, parsley, and flaky sea salt.
