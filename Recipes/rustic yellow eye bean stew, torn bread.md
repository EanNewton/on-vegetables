## Steps

### make the yellow eye beans

1.  Pick the leaves off the rosemary sprigs and set the leaves aside for the stew. Take the rosemary stems and, using kitchen twine, tie them into a bundle with the celery, carrot, and leek. In a double layer of cheesecloth, combine the parsley halves and tie up to make a sachet. Place the beans, aromatics bundle, and sachet and garlic halves and tie up to make a sachet. Place the beans, aromatics bundle, and sachet in a large pot and cover with 12 cups of water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, reduce the heat to low, and cook the beans just below a simmer, uncovered and skimming off any foam that rises to the top, until they have a creamy texture but are not falling apart. Depending on the freshness of the beans, this could take anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 1/2 hours.
2.  Remove and discard the bundle and sachet and season the beans with salt until the broth tastes good by itself. Remove the pot from the heat and set the beans and cooking liquid aside until you're ready to make the stew. You could let the beans cool to room temperature and then refrigerate until you're ready to make the stew.

### make the yellow eye bean stew

1. In a large pot, warm the olive oil over medium heat. Add the carrots first (they will take the longest), season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the celery, leeks, and greens and season with salt. Allow them to cook down, stirring, for about 5 minutes.
2. Add the chopped garlic, rosemary, and chilli flakes -- you want the garlic to become fragrant but not browned. Add the tomato paste and stir thoroughly to combine. Cook for about 2 minutes, allowing the tomato paste to toast. At this point, all of the vegetables should be cooked through but still have a bite. Taste them to make sure, and if they have too much bite, let them go a little longer.
3. Add the cooked beans, along with their liquid, and bring the pot to a simmer. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Remove from the heat.

### to serve
1. Toss the bread with a touch of olive oil and season with salt. Toast over medium heat in a large saute pan until crispy on the edges, 3 to 5 minutes. Ladle the stew into bowls, and then follow with the toasted bread. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil.
