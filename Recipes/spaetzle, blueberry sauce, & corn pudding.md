## Steps


### make the blueberry sauce
1.  In a small pot, combine the berries, sugar, and 1/4 cup water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the blueberries soften and the liquid begins to thicken, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Let cool slightly before using, or cool completely, cover, and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Serve the sauce at room temperature.

### make the spaetzle
1. In a bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Add the flour, milk, sugar, and salt and mix until thoroughly combined -- the batter should look pretty similar to pancake batter.
2. Bring a large pot of water to a simmer. Prepare an ice bath in a bowl.
3. Push the batter through a perforated hotel pan, colander, or spaetzle maker into the simmering water and cook until the spaetzle float at the top, about 1 minute.
4. Drain and transfer the spaetzle to the ice bath until cool. Drain again, then toss with the grapeseed oil. Transfer to baking sheets, using your fingers to break up the individual dumplings, and let them dry. If you are holding them for longer than a couple of hours, cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day.

### to serve
1. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Melt the butter in the pan and cook until it begins to brown. Add the spaetzle and cook until golden brown and slightly crispy. Season lightly with salt and then drain on paper towels.
2. When ready to serve, place a dollop of corn pudding on each of 4 plates. Lay 3 mounds of spaetzle around the pudding. Top with blueberry sauce and garnish with mint leaves.
