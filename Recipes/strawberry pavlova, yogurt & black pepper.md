## Steps

### dehydrated strawberry powder
1. Arrange the strawberries on dehydrator trays and dehydrate at 135 F / 57 C for 12 to 16 hours, until completely dehydrated. Transfer to a spice grinder or a mortar and pestle and grind to a fine powder.

### meringues
1. Preheat the oven to 225 F / 110 C
2. In a bowl combine the superfine sugar and cornstarch and mix well. Set aside.
3. In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt on low speed. Increase the speed to medium and whisk until the mixture becomes frothy, 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Add the sugar and cornstarch mixture in three equal parts -- it's okay if the sugar doesn't quite dissolve all the way right now -- and continue to whisk until the egg whites start to form peaks, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the vanilla and vinegar and continue whisking until stiff peaks form, another 3 to 5 minutes. Turn the mixer off.
5. Line an 18 x 13 inch baking sheet with parchment or silicone baking mat. Using a 3 oz (45 ml) ice cream scoop, form 6 individual meringues on the lined pan. Bake for 1 hour, rotating the pan every 15 minutes. Then reduce the oven temperature to 200 F (95 C) and bake for 1 more hour (you don't need to rotate anymore). When the meringues are done, they should peel off easily from the parchment and have a hard exterior with a soft interior. Let the meringues cool to room temperature.

### macerated strawberries
1. In a bowl, combine the strawberries, granulated sugar, salt, pepper, and rosewater and toss to combine. Set aside for at least 30 minutes and refrigerate until ready to serve.

### yogurt cream
1. In a bowl, whip the cream to stiff peaks and fold in the yogurt until combined. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

### to serve
1. To serve, slice through the meringues horizontally, like splitting a burger bun. Place a bottom piece on each plate and spoon the yogurt cream onto it. Add macerated strawberries, then drizzle some of the juices over them. Place the top of the meringue over the strawberries. With a fine-mesh sieve, sift the dehydrated strawberry powder over the Pavlova.
